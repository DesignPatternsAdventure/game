This task hasn't been Implemented yet!

FYI: We are considering making this a task to implement different algorithms for random
walking vs. follow the player. The task could demonstrate how the implementation
shouldn't be dependent on the algorithm.

Alternatively, for this task, the user could create logic to generate vegetation and
static items that can be picked up or used
