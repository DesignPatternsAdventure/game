This task hasn't been Implemented yet!

FYI: we are planning to make this task the implementation of raft so that the player
can escape the small island and make it to the mainland. This task could explore how
making an abstract GameSprite could break the Interface Segregation Principle if
methods for both the player and vehicle are expected
